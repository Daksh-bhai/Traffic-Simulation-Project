# # Traffic-Simulation-Project
•	Simulate traffic flow at an intersection with realistic vehicle movement.
•	Implement deadlock prevention to ensure vehicles don’t get stuck.
•	Optimize traffic flow using algorithms to reduce congestion.
•	Store and retrieve vehicle information accurately and efficiently.

# Tech Stack Used : HTML,CSS,JAVASCRIPT (p5.js) , PHP
# Architecture of the Project
Use a modular full-stack approach: Frontend + Backend + Database.
Frontend (Visualization & UI) – JavaScript , HTML, CSS
•	Render roads, intersections, and moving vehicles.
•	Display real-time traffic light status, no. of vehicles, system status
Backend (Traffic Logic & Deadlock Prevention) –JavaScript
•	Implement deadlock prevention using mutexes, Banker’s Algorithm.
•	 Manage vehicle priority, traffic signals, and deadlock resolution.
  Database (Data Layer) 
•	Records and manages vehicle data.
•	Tracks traffic violations or activity.
•	Provides an interface for operators/admins to manage traffic flow information
Testing & Deployment – Docker, GitHub Pages, Web Servers
•	Unit test deadlock scenarios implementing through Javascript.
•	Deploy the project on GitHub Pages or a web server.
